  <h2>The Great Dividers</h2>
    <p>
      Humans originated from Elkus, a desolate and unforgiving land populated by aggressive creatures that constantly preyed upon those without the vigilance or strength to defend themselves. Humans learned to survive by using their few resources, superior ingenuity, and adaptability to defend against their predators. Eventually, they improved their combat skills and resilience to overcome more powerful creatures and become the predators themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their expansion from there was nearly unstoppable. Humans thirsted for more and finer resources, and their militaristic society quickly overpowered and assimilated each land and race on their warpath. Repurposing the weapons and practices of conquered peoples to accelerate their proliferation, they forged an empire that remained for over a millennium.
    </p> 
    <p>
      However, the brutality of the River Lily Empire's creation lives on to this day in the simmering resentment of races subjugated by humans. The Empire now occupies most of the central mainland, a testament to humanity's overwhelming greed. While not all humans share the imperialist views of their ancestors, all still carry the ghosts of the past upon their backs.
    </p>

  <h2>All Walks of Life</h2>
    <p>
      Unlike most races, humans are not dispositioned toward any single fate. Their very nature seems to balance out every tarnished soul with a radiant counterpart. Even then, the darkest of hearts have an inkling of light and vice versa. Their propensity for change and deviance from the norm allows for a great number to break away from the cycle of hatred.
    </p>
    <p>
      This unnatural spark paves the way for humans to not gravitate toward any one school of combat. A man could be naturally inclined to the study of magic, while his sister could be a military savant.

Dwarves
 
 <h2>Children of the Mountain</h2>
  <p>
  Short proud, and stout, the dwarves are some of the best craftsmen in the land, and they know it too. They have built longstanding marvels of cities across their mountainous homes, and have come to be some of the first that mended old wounds with humanity. Throughout all recorded time, one thing has remained clear and certain about the hearty dwarves: their unbreakable and unyielding will. The squat and stubborn folk of the mountains deep will rarely bend to outside influence. This paves way for a hearty amount of pride, which can lead to grudges that oft last generations. Despite their rowdy nature, earning the respect of a dwarf builds a friendship that will last well beyond the mountains.
  </p>

  </p>
  <p>
  <i><b>Ability Score Increase.</i></b> Your Strength increases by 2.
 
  <br><i><b>Dwarven Armor Training.</i></b> You have proficiency with light and medium armor.
  </p>
 


Elves

 <h2>Guardians of the Forest</h2>
  <p>
  The Great War exiled the elves from their native lands, leaving them to resettle in the secluded forests of the Sylvan Conclave. This isolation strengthened their already deep bond with nature. The old noble houses are now embroiled in political conflict over whether to re-integrate into society outside the Sylvan forests or to isolate themselves and protect what little home they have left.
  </p>
 <h1>Playable Traits</h1>
  <p>
  <i><b>Ability Score Increase.</i></b> Your Dexterity increases by 2.
 
  <br><i><b>Age.</i></b> Although elves reach physical maturity around the same age as humans, the elven understanding of adulthood goes beyond physical growth to encompass worldly experience. An elf typically claims adulthood and an adult name around the age of 100 and can live to 750 years old.

  <br><i><b>Darkvision.</i></b> You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.

  <br><i><b>Fey Ancestry.</i></b> You have advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic can't put you to sleep.
 
  <br><i><b>Trance.</i></b> Elves don't need to sleep. Instead, they meditate deeply, remaining semiconscious, for 4 hours a day. (The Common word for such meditation is "trance.") While meditating, you can dream after a fashion; such dreams are mental exercises that have become reflexive through years of practice. After resting in this way, you gain the same benefit that a human does from 8 hours of sleep.
 
  <br><i><b>Subrace.</i></b> Elven kind, even at its lowest point, still consists of many types. Choose one of the following as your subrace.
  </p>
 <h3>Drow</h3>
  <p>
  Drow fled the Great War into the Underdark and were cursed by its dark magic. Other elves consider them cowards, and their Underdark curse ostracizes them from much of surface-dwelling society.

  <br><i><b>Extra Language.</i></b> You can speak, read, and write Undercommon.

  <br><i><b>Elf Weapon Training.</i></b> You have proficiency with the longsword, shortsword, shortbow, and longbow.

 <h3>Wood Elf</h3>

They took in other elves graciously but soon found themselves in political battles for control over their homeland.
  </p>
  <p>
  <i><b>Ability Score Increase.</i></b> Your Intelligence increases by 1.

Gnomes
 
 <h2>Secluded Wonders</h2>

You can have up to three such devices active at a time.
  When you create a device, choose one of the following options.
  <ul>
  <li>Clockwork Toy. This toy is a clockwork animal, monster, or person, such as a frog, mouse, bird, dragon, or soldier. When placed on the ground, the toy moves 5 feet across the ground on each of your turns in a random direction. It makes noises as appropriate to the creature it represents.

  </p>
 


Halfling
 
 <h2>Embracers of Eccentricity</h2>
  <p>
  The small, lovable people of the rolling hills, halflings are happy-go-lucky and love nothing more than learning new cultures and ideas. Many other races are taken aback by their hospitality, but their unnatural luck, a gift from the god Shak-el-Shak, protects their unguarded nature.

The Elderkin

  Unlike others, these races were created by higher powers or came into being as a result of their actions. From gods to dragons, they are not bound explicitly by their patron entities, but often revere or honor their creators.
 
 ### Old Ways in the New World
  Because of the nature of their origin, many of the so-called Elderkin came into being in a very different world. They may struggle or excel because of this, but are often fish out of water in modern society.
 
 

Dragonborn
 
 <h2>Children of the Ancients</h2>
  <p>
  The dragons, ancient and powerful beyond comprehension, are kept by ancestral vow in the volcanic and hellish Spiremaw peaks. Still wishing to see the outside world and know its wonders, they magically created the dragonborn. Mortal beings forged in the image of their makers, their purpose was to go out, live full and hateful lives, and create adventurous stories with which to one day return to the volcanic peaks and regale their caged creators.
  </p>
 <h2>Free of Burden</h2>
  <p>
  As race with free will, the children of dragons are not restricted by duty as their parents are. They still foster a deep respect for their progenitors, but are not bound to one day return to the peaks.

Half-Orcs
 
 <h2>The Old Conquerors</h2>
  <p>
  When the mountains were young, the god known as Grog created the prosperous orc species which has since fallen into a greedy, ruthless culture that reminisces about the days of yore. The orcs were made for war, which, when combined with human blood, births a being in constant conflict with itself. Half-orcs revel in the dangers and ferocity of combat but are not defined by it. They can now break free from the drums of war.

Easifa
 
 <h2>The Eldest and Humblest Kin</h2>
  <p>
  The True Mother, goddess of origination, Solis, did very little to affect the mortal world directly, save for the creation of the easifan race. She fostered them to inhabit the then-barren world, with cooperative instincts to overcome any hardship. This care, in turn, caused Easifa to be eternally grateful. They were the first mortal species, and their civilization observed as gods shaped and molded the world around them into a veritable paradise.
  <br>Despite the longevity of their society, Easifa are content with each other, granting little concern to technological advancement. They instead focus on oral tradition and shared stories, as the creators of the language now known as Common. While they have little in the way of written history, the stories they share are rich, vivid windows into the past.
  </p>


 <h2>Strongest of Bonds</h2>
  <p>
  The Easifa are hard-wired to work well with others; it is necessary for their survival. They take great joy in learning new points of view. Merchants will travel through the harshest conditions across the world and share wonderful stories with those they meet along the way. 
  <br>Similarly, because of their desert home, their society focuses less on strict laws than accomplishing common goals. Trust is worth more than gold to Easifa, and going back on oneâ€™s word is considered one of the greatest sins.

Kanin

 <h2>Mystic Amazons</h2>
  <p>
  Kanin are an all-female race of strong, tall humanoids with large hare-like ears. They usually live in small nomadic tribes that exist across the west coast of Fehrâ€™gia in its harshest and most lush environs, even journeying into the Underdark from time to time. These tribes are often hidden by fey-like magics, imperceivable by most travellers.
  </p>
 <h2>The Pilgrimage</h2>
  <p>
  As a rite of passage for all Kanin in their 20th year, they embark from their village to live in the outside world with little to no aid from their tribe. These pilgrimages often take them across the continent, or even to distant islands, and can last decades or even centuries. When they have finished their journey, they return to their tribe. The elder will confer with them about their findings, and this will culminate in the greatest decision in a Kaninâ€™s life. Will they leave the tribe forever to remain a part of the outside world, or stay with their family and friends in the tribe, estranged from the rest of Fehrâ€™gia?

The Veil Touched
 
 <h2>The Veil</h2>
  There are planes beyond our own that once intimately mingled with the material realm. As time passed and empires rose, the intersections with these planes became rarer and rarer until only the holiest land of Chrom remained as a reliable gateway. This is thought to be due to a power known only as the "Great Veil."
  This strange force is thought to be an act from the gods to protect mortals from the disastrous and dangerous beings that lie just beyond it, great demons and powerful genies eager to conquer all of creation.
 
 <h2>Gifted Souls</h2>
  The Veil acts of its own accord, and as it shifts weak points emerge where powers from other planes can pierce through. At these points, demons, devils, elementals, and all manner of creatures may break through and bring with them energies that mingle with the very essence of our world. This essence can destroy, create, or in some instances change beings in their very nature. 
 

 
Aasimar
 
 <h2>Planar Souls</h2>
  <p>
  Aasimar are usually the result of souls who have been touched by energies from the holiest plane of the gods. Often favored angels are directly created, but in rare cases favored champions are taken up by their patrons into the plane of Atlas, home of the gods. 
  Even more rarely, when the gods themselves travel to the planes of mortals, the Veil shifts and allows energies from Atlas to enter the world briefly, changing landscapes and creatures alike.

Tieflings
 
 <h2>Infernal Souls</h2>
  <p>
  Opposite the aasimar are the tieflings: individuals who have been touched by the demonic and damned energies of the Nine Hells.

Genasi
 
 <h2>Elemental Children</h2>
  <p>
  The tales of aasimar and tieflings are often unfortunate happenstance and tragedies, while genasi are a more novel class of Veil Touched souls. Genasi are born of primordial planes, which imbue them with elemental energies unique to the creatures and objects conceived there. Because of their tumultuous origins, many genasi are unfamiliar with the source of these characteristics.

Shifters

 <h2>Spirit Guided, Heart Driven</h2>
  <p>
  Mortals rarely choose to explore the world of spirits. Rarer still do those that seek answers ever make contact. Nature spirits are those who most often choose to connect with mortals, some of whom, called shifters, are conferred a gift from the spirit realm. Some cultures consider the shifter's gift a blessing, others a curse. Most receive their gifts at birth, but a shifter can come into existence at other times in life when the mortal soul reaches beyond the material plane. Some restore life to the sick and dying, others seek a stronger bond with the natural world, and others simply happen across a mischievous spirit on the wrong side of the oak. Whatever the inciting incident, shifters walk the line between mortal civilization and the infinite wilds.

  <br><i><b>Natural Armor.</i></b> Due to your shell and the shape of your body, you are ill-suited to wearing armor. However, your shell provides ample protection, and gives you a base AC of 17 (unaffected by your Dexterity modifier).

Minotaurs
 
 <h2>Mighty Warriors, Bellowing Souls</h2>

Satyrs
 
 <h2>Charismatic Revelers</h2>
  <p>

Melambai

 <h2>Diversity of the Abyss</h2>
  <p>
  Melambai spawn from the deepest oceans with a mix of spiritual and fey ancestry. As diverse as the fauna of the trenches, some appear humanoid with minor piscine traits, and others more closely resemble fish, crustaceans, or other invertebrates. A few even resemble coral, anemones, or other unique sea creatures.
  </p>  
 <h2>Deep Castaways</h2>
  <p>
  Millenia ago, the melambai were proud and prosperous citizens of a magnificent kingdom spanning the depths of vast oceans. Long ago, their leaders made a pact with a being known as Sili Togafiti to allow their species to travel upward to the surface and breathe air. The goddess Gracia, however, saw this as a terrible curse. For abandoning her realm, she cast them out from their utopian kingdom. Melambai now reside in mainland coastal towns and on the islands of The Reaches, and their former home lies guarded by the most powerful of Marids, its secrets locked away for eternity.
  </p>
 <h2>Of Spirits and Honor</h2>
  <p>
  Their home and culture lost, melambai have learned the importance of honor and spirituality. Many elders are deeply humble, spending their last years meditating to seek the wisdom of the unseen world. While the younglings are often overcome by crashing waves of rage when their family or loved ones are insulted, it is in their nature to instead focus on solutions and seek forgiveness, gratitude, and love.

You can't increase a spell's level when casting with this trait.

Ratlings
 
 <h2>The Lords of Trash</h2>
  <p>
  The kings of derelict alleyways, the sultans of garbage: these are the ratlings' only domains. They are the lowest caste wherever they are unfortunate enough to tread.

Once you use this trait, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

# Unnatural Souls
 
 ### Monsters and Constructs
  There are, of course, others who survive in Fehr'gia. They are of no natural breed nor cause; no god forged them, nor did they arrive in society naturally. Either by accident or by experiment, they joined the ranks of the masses for their own purposes. Many may look down on them, and others even fear and shun them. Still, they continue despite the discrimination.
 


Warforged
 
 <h2>Of Art and War</h2>
  <p>
  It is unknown why the gnomes created the first warforged. The process has been repeated over the years, creating true life from metal and magic.

# Goblin
 
 ### From Humblest Beginnings, Chaos
  Goblins were a plague on the world, thought to be a sick joke from the gods by many, pests by some, and snacks by orcs. They live in small tribes for self-defense and must fight against a world that seems to want them dead. 
  Despite all the hardship and pain that they have endured since the beginning of time, they remain to this day. Some goblins have even advanced in the world, venturing into society by themselves. They have every opportunity to improve their living standards and rise above the limits set on them from the start. 
  Or they might steal a nice hat from the local rubbish.

  <br><i><b>Nimble Escape.</i></b> You can take the Disengage or Hide action as a bonus action on each of your turns.
 


Kobolds
 
 <h2>The Aspiring Embers</h2>
  <p>
  Kobolds would be quick to tell you of their mighty heritage, how, like dragonborn, they descend from the mighty flying gods that they worship. Of course, this is wrong. They evolved to look like smaller, scrawnier dragons by simple chance, and their incidental resemblance convinced them that they are related. While every factor is against them, they have the potential to prove their worth to the world.

Ethereals
 
 <h2>The Mortal Weave</h2>
  <p>
  There are times when the weave flows through souls, creating the Veil Touched. In the rarest instances, this process can happen in reverse. Acts of supreme magic, will, or intellect can be reflected in the nature of the weave and birth new entities: the ethereals. Magic given humanoid form and intelligence. First thought to be children of Karasu, now it is known that they are of entirely unique origin.
  </p>
 <h2>Living Reflection</h2>
  <p>
  Ethereals are usually reflections of the circumstances of their creation. Those that were created by a grand wizard's machinations would likely be stoic, while those that resulted from the death of an eldritch knight might be more ravenous or vicious. Those that resulted from magical explosions could be proud, bombastic, or even eccentric. Regardless of their designs, each one is unique.
  </p>
 <h2>Weave's Attraction</h2>
  <p>
  Given their unique form, many ethereals find it easier to maneuver through society covered in wrappings, clothes, or even leaves. These organic coverings attract and stick to their body that is made of energy itself.

# Myconids
 
 <h2>Cultivators of Fargrow Reach</h2>
  <p>
  Below the first vast caves of Fargrow Reach are large mushroom forests of glowing fungus and algae. Myconids, fungal folk of odd circumstances, steward these magical lands. Left to their own devices until the war, it is unknown how they were created or how they survived the horrid Underdark. Their culture does not dwell on the past, choosing to band together and survive in the future. Because of this, they do not have any written records from their ancient history, simply legends and tales handed down by word of mouth.
  </p>
 <h2>Bonds of Mind and Body</h2>
  <p>
  All myconids are taught and have a seemingly natural understanding of The Dream. The Dream is a mystical force that all living creatures experience subconsciously, connecting them to the wider world and those around them. Many explorers are welcomed and celebrated in myconids' homes.

  <p>
  "The Wolf in Sheep's Clothing" is a household tale with dark origins: creatures that can change shape, adopting the persona of your neighbor perfectly until it is too late.
