    Classes, subclasses, and spells from the following sourcebooks are legal for play: PHB, XGE, TCE, DMG, EGW*, FTD. Feats, psionics and classes that use them, and the Echo Knight subclass are banned from play. Spells of level 2 and lower which allow for a "free" long rest (e.g. by generating food and sustenance) consume their material components. Other spells may be allowed or banned at your DM's discretion.
