    Classes, subclasses, and spells from the following sourcebooks are legal for play: PHB, XGE, TCE, DMG, EGW, FTD. Psionics, their associated classes and feats, and the Echo Knight subclass are banned from play. Spells of level 2 and lower that allow for a "free" long rest (e.g. by generating food and sustenance) will consume their material components. Other spells may be allowed or banned at your DM's discretion.
