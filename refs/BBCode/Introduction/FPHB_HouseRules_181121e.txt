[h2]General Rules[/h2]
    [h3]Flanking[/h3]
        [p]
            Flanking and its associated optional rules are used: [url=https://5e.tools/variantrules.html#flanking_dmg]Flanking[/url], pinning, and height advantage
            [ul]
                [li][b]Flanking.[/b] Allied creatures have advantage on attack rolls with melee weapon attacks when on opposite sides of a creature no larger than one size class larger than the smallest of the two allied creatures. Creatures are on opposite sides if both creatures are within 5 feet of opposing corners of their target.[/li]
                [li][b]Pinning.[/b] A creature has advantage on melee weapon attacks if their target creature is the same or smaller size and directly between the attacking creature and a wall.[/li]
                [li][b]Height.[/b] A creature has advantage on ranged weapon attacks if they are at least 10 feet above and 5 feet away from the target creature.[/li]
            [/ul]
        [/p]
    [h3]Advantage[/h3]
        [p]
            Multiple sources of advantage add 1d4 to the advantaged roll. Multiple sources of disadvantage subtract 1d4 from the disadvantaged roll. This does not stack; no bonus or penalty will be greater than 1d4.
        [/p]
    [h3]Inspiration[/h3]
        [p]
            Inspiration can be used to reroll any roll for a character you can see or gain gp equal to the character's levelX10. A player can't transfer inspiration between their characters, and cannot save excess points of inspiration.
        [/p]
    [h3]Player Summons[/h3]
        [p]
            Multiple player summons will use [url=https://5e.tools/book.html#DMG,8,handling%20mobs,0]mob combat rules[/url] and share their turn with the summoner.
        [/p]
    [h3]Massive Damage[/h3]
        [p]
            When a character takes damage equal to or greater than its hit point maximum from a single source, they die immediately. Critical hits will not inflict lasting injuries.
        [/p]
    [h3]Unconscious Roleplay[/h3]
        [p]
            For roleplay purposes, when you hit 0 hp and start rolling death saves, you may choose whether or not you are unconscious. You are unable to take any actions besides speaking as a free action if you remain awake.
        [/p]

        [h3]Martial Skill[/h3]
            [p]
                Martial checks adeptly assess other characters and enemies. You can roll a d20 to attempt to rate a creature's strength relative to you or your party. On a successful martial check, each creature with traits will have its number of traits and one trait with its effects revealed at random.
                [br]Fighters, Rangers, Hunters, Bastions, and Paladins may gain proficiency in this skill at level 1.
            [/p]
    [/aloud]
[h2]Optional Rules[/h2]
    [h3]Contributing Encouters[/h3]
        [p]
            Any player may propose a pair of random encounters via DM to your DM: one negative, one positive. The DM reserves the right to deny entries.
        [/p]
    [h3]Custom Spells[/h3]
        [p]
            If the DM changes a spell's effects or balance after a player has taken it, the player may replace it with another spell of the same or lower level.
        [/p]
    [h3]Brutality Mode[/h3]
        [p]
            Death save failures can only be removed on long rests with food and drink, similar to levels of exhaustion. Rolling a natural 20 will not give a character 1 hp unless the player already has at least one successful death save.
        [/p]
