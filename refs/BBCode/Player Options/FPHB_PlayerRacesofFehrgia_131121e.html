    <p>
        Many creatures claim the world of Fehr'gia as their home and originate from a few distinct roots.
        <ul>
            <li><b>Inheritors of Fehr'gia.</b> These ancient races stem from a divergent line of evolution. Through a stroke of fate, they inherited the land of Fehr'gia and founded civilizations that rule over the mainland to this day.</li>
            <li><b>The Elderkin.</b> Beings of a higher power created these races for various reasons. They are not bound to their creators and are more or less free to explore the world.</li>
            <li><b>The Veil-Touched.</b> Souls changed, wilfully or otherwise, by energies of otherworldly planes.</li>
            <li><b>Children of The Reaches.</b> Denizens of the far lands known as The Reaches. They vary widely in shape, size, and lineage.</li>
            <li><b>Unnatural Souls.</b> Creatures that do not fit directly into the other races.</li>
        </ul>

         <!-- Would like to have a list of links to pages for each playable race. Each playable race article should either have relevant history listed beneath in-game features or should link to associated pages. Would like to set up a tag system to help navigate these. -->
