[h2]Planar Souls[/h2]
    [p]
    Aasimar are usually the result of souls who have been touched by energies from the holiest plane of the gods. Often favored angels are directly created, but in rare cases favored champions are taken up by their patrons into the plane of Atlas, home of the gods. 
    [br]Even more rarely, when the gods themselves travel to the planes of mortals, the Veil shifts and allows energies from Atlas to enter the world briefly, changing landscapes and creatures alike.
