[h2]Planar Souls[/h2]
    [p]
        Aasimar are souls who have been touched by energies from Atlas, the plane of the gods. Often gods create the angels themselves, but in rare cases, patrons elevate favored champions from other realms to live alongside them in Atlas. When the gods visit the Prime Material, energy from Atlas brielfy can enter the world and transform receptive mortals into aasimar.
