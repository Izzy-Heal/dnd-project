[h2]Children of the Ancients[/h2]
    [p]
        The dragons are bound to their hellish lands by an extraplanar vow, never to see the grander world of Fehr'gia. They still wished to escape and explore, and while they could not use their mighty power to free themselves, they could create lower beings unbound by higher forces. Mortals forged in the image of their makers, the Dragonborn's purpose was to go out, live full and hateful lives, and create adventurous stories with which to one day regale their caged creators.

[h2]Free of Burden[/h2]
    [p]
        As creatures with free will, the children of dragons are not restricted by ancient pacts as their parents are. While they are not bound to return to their homeland, they still foster a deep respect for their forebearers.
