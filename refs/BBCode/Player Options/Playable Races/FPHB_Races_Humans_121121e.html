    <h1>Humans</h1>
    <h2>The Great Dividers</h2>
        <p class="r_desc">
            Humans originated from Elkus, a desolate and unforgiving land populated by aggressive creatures that constantly preyed upon those without the vigilance or strength to defend themselves. Humans learned to survive by using their few resources, superior ingenuity, and adaptability to defend against their predators. Eventually, they improved their combat skills and resilience to overcome more powerful creatures and become the predators themselves.
        </p>
        <p class="r_desc">
            Their expansion from there was nearly unstoppable. Humans thirsted for more and finer resources, and their militaristic society quickly overpowered and assimilated each land and race on their warpath. Repurposing the weapons and practices of conquered peoples to accelerate their proliferation, they forged an empire that remained for over a millennium.
        </p> 
        <p class="r_desc">
            However, the brutality of the River Lily Empire's creation lives on to this day in the simmering resentment of races subjugated by humans. The Empire now occupies most of the central mainland, a testament to humanity's overwhelming greed. While not all humans share the imperialist views of their ancestors, all still carry the ghosts of the past upon their backs.
        </p>
  
    <h2>All Walks of Life</h2>
        <p class="r_desc">
            Unlike most races, humans are not dispositioned toward any single fate. Their very nature seems to balance out every tarnished soul with a radiant counterpart. Even then, the darkest of hearts have an inkling of light and vice versa. Their propensity for change and deviance from the norm allows for a great number to break away from the cycle of hatred.
        </p>
        <p class="r_desc">
            This unnatural spark paves the way for humans to not gravitate toward any one school of combat. A man could be naturally inclined to the study of magic, while his sister could be a military savant.
