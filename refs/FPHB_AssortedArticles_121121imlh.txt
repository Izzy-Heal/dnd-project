Player Races of Fehr'gia
 [Grammarly doc: https://app.grammarly.com/ddocs/1367847027]
 [p]
 Many creatures claim the world of Fehr'gia as their home and originate from a few distinct roots.
 [ul]
  [li][b]Inheritors of Fehr'gia.[/b] These ancient races stem from a divergent line of evolution. Through a stroke of fate, they inherited the land of Fehr'gia and founded civilizations that rule over the mainland to this day.[/li]
  [li][b]The Elderkin.[/b] Beings of a higher power created these races for various reasons. They are not bound to their creators and are more or less free to explore the world.[/li]
  [li][b]The Veil-Touched.[/b] Souls changed, wilfully or otherwise, by energies of otherworldly planes.[/li]
  [li][b]Children of The Reaches.[/b] Denizens of the far lands known as The Reaches. They vary widely in shape, size, and lineage.[/li]
  [li][b]Unnatural Souls.[/b] Creatures that do not fit directly into the other races.[/li]
 [/ul]

House Rules
 [h2]General Rules[/h2]
 [h3]Flanking[/h3]
  [p]
  Flanking and its associated optional rules are used: [url:https://5e.tools/variantrules.html#flanking_dmg]Flanking[/url], pinning, and height advantage
  [ul]
   [li][b]Flanking.[/b] Allied creatures gain advantage to attack rolls on melee weapon attacks when on opposite sides of a creature no larger than one size class larger than the smallest of the two allied creatures. Creatures are on the opposite sides if both creatures are within 5 feet of opposing corners of their target.[/li]
   [li][b]Pinning.[/b] A creature gains advantage on melee weapon attacks if their target creature is the same or smaller size and directly between the attacking creature and a wall.[/li]
   [li][b]Height.[/b] A creature gains advantage on ranged weapon attacks if they are at least 10 feet above and 5 feet away from the target creature.[/li]
  [/ul]
  [/p]
 [h3]Advantage[/h3]
  [p]
  Multiple sources of advantage add a d4 to the roll. Multiple sources of disadvantage subtract a d4 from the roll. This does not stack; no bonus or penalty will be greater than 1d4.
  [/p]
 [h3]Inspiration[/h3]
  [p]
  Inspiration can be used to reroll any roll for a character you can see or gain gp equal to the character's levelX10. A player can't transfer inspiration between their characters.
  [/p]
 [h3]Player Summons[/h3]
  [p]
  Multiple player summons will use [url:https://5e.tools/book.html#DMG,8,handling%20mobs,0]mob combat rules[/url] and share their turn with the summoner.
  [/p]
 [h3]Massive Damage[/h3]
  [p]
  When a character takes damage from a single source equal to or greater than its hit point maximum, they die immediately. Critical hits will not inflict lasting injuries.
  [/p]
 [h3]Unconscious Roleplay[/h3]
  [p]
  For roleplay purposes, when you hit 0 hp and start rolling death saves, you may choose whether or not you are unconscious. You are unable to take any actions besides speaking as a free action if you remain awake.
  [/p]
 [h3]Firearms and Guns[/h3]
  [p]
  Rules for firearms and associated ammunition are listed [url:https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-LaQ-9bfLBNNBm-hoMee]here[/url].
  [/p]
 [h3]Magical Tattoos[/h3]
  [p]
  Rules for magical tattoos are listed [url:https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-LCger_-0N85d-tKgKRK]here[/url].
  [/p]
 [aloud]
 [h3]Martial Skill[/h3]
  [p]
  Martial checks adeptly assess other characters and enemies. You can roll a d20 to attempt to rate a creature's strength relative to you or your party. On a successful martial check, each creature with traits will have its number of traits and one trait with its effects revealed at random.
  [br]Fighters, Ranger, Hunters, Bastions, and Paladins may gain proficiency in this skill at level 1.
  [/p]
 [/aloud]
 [h2]Options[/h2]
 [h3]Contributing Encouters[/h3]
  [p]
   Any player may propose a pair of random encounters via DM to Jeremy: one negative, one positive. Jeremy reserves the right to deny entries.
  [/p]
 [h3]Custom Spells[/h3]
  [p]
  If Jeremy changes a spell's effects or balance after a player has taken it, the player may replace it with another spell of the same or lower level.
  [/p]
 [h3]Brutality Mode[/h3]
  [p]
  Death save failures can only be removed on long rests with food and drink, similar to levels of exhaustion. Rolling a natural 20 will not give a character 1 hp unless the player already has at least one successful death save.
  [/p]
Oil Crafting
 [Grammarly doc: https://app.grammarly.com/ddocs/1368518606]
 [h1]Crafting Oils[/h1]
  [p]
  The old ways tell of special decoctions, powerful alchemical brews meant for hunting beasts that stalked the world. The first huntsman left many detailed notes on slaying creatures, none more brutal than their blade oils. Over time, more powerful brews were concocted and their recipes recorded for specialized purposes.
  [/p]
 [h2]Collecting components[/h2]
  [p]
  After slaying monsters, it is common to gather their parts for later use. Reagents are collected using a Survival check on a dead creature or alchemist's supplies during downtime to either search for botanic reagents with a Nature check on long rests or harvest blood from beasts with Animal Handling. You may increment your oil reagent pouch (listed below) towards completion with successfully harvested reagents.
  [br]Potent reagents required for specific oils come from certain creatures or plants and must be tracked separately. Merchants may also carry ingredients for your oils.
  [/p]
  [aloud]
  [h3]Oil Reagent Pouch (0/3)[/h3]
   [p]
   10 sp. 10lbs
   [br]An oil reagent pouch stores the necessary alchemical ingredients for oil crafting. Basic harvested components increment this pouch at your DM’s discretion. When this pouch is full, you can use it to craft an oil.
   [/p]
   [h3]Crafting an Oil[/h3]
    [p]
    Crafting an oil requires at least 3 items: alchemist's supplies, a full oil reagent pouch (3/3), and a potent regent listed in the oil’s ingredients. Once you have all 3, you spend 1 hour brewing your intended oil. You will find a list of all oils with their potent reagents below.
    [/p]
  [/aloud]
 [h2]Using an Oil[/h2]
 [p]
  As an action, you can apply an oil to a weapon. You may coat one melee weapon or up to 5 pieces of ranged ammunition in oil. Oils and most oil-based effects last for 1 minute. Using weapon oil consumes the entire oil. Using weapon oil removes any existing poison or oil on the weapon.

 [h2]Collecting Ingredients[/h2]
 [p]
 Characters need to eat, and sometimes rations are insufficient. When adventurers kill beasts, plants, or other similar creatures, they can gather ingredients to later make into food.
 [br]Harvesting ingredients from creatures requires a Survival check, and harvesting from plants a Nature check; the DM determines the DCs. The following tables determine how many ingredients you harvest.

 [h2]Preparing Meals[/h2]
 [p]
 Once you have ingredients, you can spend a long rest or in-game downtime preparing meals. To prepare a meal, make a series of ability checks based on the ingredients and tools used. The DM determines which abilities and how many checks are necessary to prepare a particular meal. The average of the rolls determines the nutrition and effects of the meal based on the following table:
 [/p]
 [h3]Average Roll[/h3]

 [/p]
 [h4]Example Recipe[/h4]
 [p]
 Steak: 1 meat and 1 plant, requiring 1 Intelligence and 2 Wisdom checks.
 [br] 
 [br]Recipes can vary wildly. Ingredients from certain monsters can contribute additional benefits or effects at your DM's discretion. These checks are affected by your ability modifier unless you have proficiency with cook's utensils, which allows you to add your proficiency bonus.
