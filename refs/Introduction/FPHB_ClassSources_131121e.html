    <p>
        Classes and subclasses from the following sourcebooks are legal for play: PHB, XGE, TCE, DMG, EGW*, FTD. Classes and subclasses listed as playable on this website are legal,Â as are Matthew Colvilles Illrigger, and Michael Wolf's <a href="https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-LCger_-0N85d-tKgKRK" target="_blank">Shaman</a>.

        *While both wizard subclasses from EGW are legal, Echo Knight is banned from play, due to the excessive packets and questions introduced by simply choosing the class.
