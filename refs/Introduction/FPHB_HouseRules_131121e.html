    <h2>General Rules</h2>
        <h3>Flanking</h3>
            <p>
                Flanking and its associated optional rules are used: <a href="https://5e.tools/variantrules.html#flanking_dmg" target="_blank">Flanking</a>, pinning, and height advantage
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Flanking.</b> Allied creatures have advantage on attack rolls with melee weapon attacks when on opposite sides of a creature no larger than one size class larger than the smallest of the two allied creatures. Creatures are on opposite sides if both creatures are within 5 feet of opposing corners of their target.</li>
                    <li><b>Pinning.</b> A creature has advantage on melee weapon attacks if their target creature is the same or smaller size and directly between the attacking creature and a wall.</li>
                    <li><b>Height.</b> A creature has advantage on ranged weapon attacks if they are at least 10 feet above and 5 feet away from the target creature.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
        <h3>Advantage</h3>
            <p>
                Multiple sources of advantage add a d4 to the roll. Multiple sources of disadvantage subtract a d4 from the roll. This does not stack; no bonus or penalty will be greater than 1d4.
            </p>
        <h3>Inspiration</h3>
            <p>
                Inspiration can be used to reroll any roll for a character you can see or gain gp equal to the character's levelX10. A player can't transfer inspiration between their characters.
            </p>
        <h3>Player Summons</h3>
            <p>
                Multiple player summons will use <a href="https://5e.tools/book.html#DMG,8,handling%20mobs,0" target="_blank">mob combat rules</a> and share their turn with the summoner.
            </p>
        <h3>Massive Damage</h3>
            <p>
                When a character takes damage equal to or greater than its hit point maximum from a single source, they die immediately. Critical hits will not inflict lasting injuries.
            </p>
        <h3>Unconscious Roleplay</h3>
            <p>
                For roleplay purposes, when you hit 0 hp and start rolling death saves, you may choose whether or not you are unconscious. You are unable to take any actions besides speaking as a free action if you remain awake.
            </p>

        <h3>Martial Skill</h3>
            <p>
                Martial checks adeptly assess other characters and enemies. You can roll a d20 to attempt to rate a creature's strength relative to you or your party. On a successful martial check, each creature with traits will have its number of traits and one trait with its effects revealed at random.
                <br>Fighters, Rangers, Hunters, Bastions, and Paladins may gain proficiency in this skill at level 1.
            </p>
    </aloud>
    <h2>Options</h2>
        <h3>Contributing Encouters</h3>
            <p>
                Any player may propose a pair of random encounters via DM to your DM: one negative, one positive. The DM reserves the right to deny entries.
            </p>
        <h3>Custom Spells</h3>
            <p>
                If the DM changes a spell's effects or balance after a player has taken it, the player may replace it with another spell of the same or lower level.
            </p>
        <h3>Brutality Mode</h3>
            <p>
                Death save failures can only be removed on long rests with food and drink, similar to levels of exhaustion. Rolling a natural 20 will not give a character 1 hp unless the player already has at least one successful death save.
