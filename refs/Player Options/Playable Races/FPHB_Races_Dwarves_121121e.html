    <h1>Dwarves</h1>
    <h2>Children of the Mountain</h2>
        <p class="r_desc">
            Short proud, and stout, the dwarves are some of the best craftsmen in the land, and they know it too. They have built longstanding marvels of cities across their mountainous homes, and have come to be some of the first that mended old wounds with humanity. Throughout all recorded time, one thing has remained clear and certain about the hearty dwarves: their unbreakable and unyielding will. The squat and stubborn folk of the mountains deep will rarely bend to outside influence. This paves way for a hearty amount of pride, which can lead to grudges that oft last generations. Despite their rowdy nature, earning the respect of a dwarf builds a friendship that will last well beyond the mountains.
