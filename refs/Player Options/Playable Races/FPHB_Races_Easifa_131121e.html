    <h1>Easifa</h1>
    <h2>The Eldest and Humblest Kin</h2>
        <p>
            The True Mother, goddess of origination, Solis, did very little to affect the mortal world directly, save for the creation of the easifan race. She fostered them to inhabit the then-barren world, with cooperative instincts to overcome any hardship. This care, in turn, caused Easifa to be eternally grateful. They were the first mortal species, and their civilization observed as gods shaped and molded the world around them into a veritable paradise.

            Despite the longevity of their society, Easifa are content with each other, granting little concern to technological advancement. They instead focus on oral tradition and shared stories, as the creators of the language now known as Common. While they have little in the way of written history, the stories they share are rich, vivid windows into the past.

    <h2>Strongest of Bonds</h2>
        <p>
            The Easifa are hard-wired to work well with others; it is necessary for their survival. They take great joy in learning new points of view. Merchants will travel through the harshest conditions across the world and share wonderful stories with those they meet along the way.        </p>

            Similarly, because of their desert home, their society focuses less on strict laws than accomplishing common goals. Trust is worth more than gold to Easifa, and going back on oneâ€™s word is considered one of the greatest sins.
