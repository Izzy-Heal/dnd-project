    <h1>Elves</h1>
    <h2>Guardians of the Forest</h2>
        <p class="r_desc">
            The Great War exiled the elves from their native lands, leaving them to resettle in the secluded forests of the Sylvan Conclave. This isolation strengthened their already deep bond with nature. The old noble houses are now embroiled in political conflict over whether to re-integrate into society outside the Sylvan forests or to isolate themselves and protect what little home they have left.

        </p>
        <p>
            <i><b>Age.</i></b> Although elves reach physical maturity around the same age as humans, the elven understanding of adulthood goes beyond physical growth to encompass worldly experience. An elf typically claims adulthood and an adult name around the age of 100 and can live to 750 years old.

        <p>
            <i><b>Size.</i></b> Elves range from under 5 to over 6 feet tall and have slender builds. Your size is Medium.

        </p>
        <p>
            <i><b>Languages.</i></b> You can speak, read, and write Common and Elvish. Elvish is fluid, with subtle intonations and intricate grammar. Elven literature is rich and varied, and their songs and poems are famous among other races. Many bards learn their language so they can add Elvish ballads to their repertoires.
        </p>
        <p>
            <i><b>Darkvision.</i></b> You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.

        </p>
        <p>
            <i><b>Trance.</i></b> Elves don't need to sleep. Instead, they meditate deeply, remaining semiconscious, for 4 hours a day. (The Common word for such meditation is "trance.") While meditating, you can dream after a fashion; such dreams are mental exercises that have become reflexive through years of practice. After resting in this way, you gain the same benefit that a human does from 8 hours of sleep.
        </p>
        <p>
            <i><b>Subrace.</i></b> Elven kind, even at its lowest point, still consists of many types. Choose one of the following as your subrace.

They took in other elves graciously but soon found themselves in political battles for control over their homeland.
