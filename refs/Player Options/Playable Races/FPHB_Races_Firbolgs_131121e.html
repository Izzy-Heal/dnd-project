    <h1>Firbolgs</h1>
    <h2>The Gentle Giants</h2>
        <p class="r_desc">
        Firbolgs are among the most secluded and elusive of all Fehr'gian races, living only among the most concealed alcoves of the deepest forests. These guarded circles are where the gentlest of giants live, children of the goddess of nature Kiri. They tend to the wild, healing nature where it has been hurt and righteously defending what cannot defend itself.
