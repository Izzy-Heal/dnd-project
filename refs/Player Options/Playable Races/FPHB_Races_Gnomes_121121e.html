    <h1>Gnomes</h1>
    <h2>Secluded Wonders</h2>
        <p class="r_desc">
            Once, the gnomes were friendly to all and known by many. But the world has been harsh to the small geniuses, forcing them to seclude themselves for safety. Gnomes of old built one of the greatest wonders of the modern world: the flying city of Sud. Now they tinker away to their hearts' content, inventing and creating new wonders for the world to one day see. On occasion, gnomes may venture out into the world for personal or political reasons.
