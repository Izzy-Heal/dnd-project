        <h2>General Rules</h2>
            <h3>Flanking</h3>
                <p class="bodtxt">
                    Flanking and its associated optional rules are used: <a href="https://5e.tools/variantrules.html#flanking_dmg" target="_blank">Flanking</a>, pinning, and height advantage
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Flanking.</b> Allied creatures have advantage on attack rolls with melee weapon attacks when on opposite sides of a creature no larger than one size class larger than the smallest of the two allied creatures. Creatures are on opposite sides if both creatures are within 5 feet of opposing corners of their target.</li>
                        <li><b>Pinning.</b> A creature has advantage on melee weapon attacks if their target creature is the same or smaller size and directly between the attacking creature and a wall.</li>
                        <li><b>Height.</b> A creature has advantage on ranged weapon attacks if they are at least 10 feet above and 5 feet away from the target creature.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
            <h3>Advantage</h3>
                <p class="bodtxt">
                    Multiple sources of advantage add 1d4 to the advantaged roll. Multiple sources of disadvantage subtract 1d4 from the disadvantaged roll. This does not stack; no bonus or penalty will be greater than 1d4.
                </p>
            <h3>Inspiration</h3>
                <p class="bodtxt">
                    Inspiration can be used to reroll any roll for a character you can see or gain gp equal to the character's levelX10. A player can't transfer inspiration between their characters, and cannot save excess points of inspiration.
                </p>
            <h3>Player Summons</h3>
                <p class="bodtxt">
                    Multiple player summons will use <a href="https://5e.tools/book.html#DMG,8,handling%20mobs,0" target="_blank">mob combat rules</a> and share their turn with the summoner.
                </p>
            <h3>Massive Damage</h3>
                <p class="bodtxt">
                    When a character takes damage equal to or greater than its hit point maximum from a single source, they die immediately. Critical hits will not inflict lasting injuries.
                </p>
            <h3>Unconscious Roleplay</h3>
                <p class="bodtxt">
                    For roleplay purposes, when you hit 0 hp and start rolling death saves, you may choose whether or not you are unconscious. You are unable to take any actions besides speaking as a free action if you remain awake.
                </p>
            <h3>Firearms and Guns</h3>
                <p class="bodtxt">
                    Rules for firearms and associated ammunition are listed <a href="https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-LaQ-9bfLBNNBm-hoMee" target="_blank">here</a>.
                </p>
            <h3>Magical Tattoos</h3>
                <p class="bodtxt">
                    Rules for magical tattoos are listed <a href="https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-LCger_-0N85d-tKgKRK" target="_blank">here</a>.

        <aloud>
            <h3>Martial Skill</h3>
                <p class="bodtxt">
                    Martial checks adeptly assess other characters and enemies. You can roll a d20 to attempt to rate a creature's strength relative to you or your party. On a successful martial check, each creature with traits will have its number of traits and one trait with its effects revealed at random.
                    <br>Fighters, Rangers, Hunters, Bastions, and Paladins may gain proficiency in this skill at level 1.
                </p>
        </aloud>
        <h2>Options</h2>
            <h3>Contributing Encouters</h3>
                <p class="bodtxt">
                    Any player may propose a pair of random encounters via DM to your DM: one negative, one positive. The DM reserves the right to deny entries.
                </p>
            <h3>Custom Spells</h3>
                <p class="bodtxt">
                    If the DM changes a spell's effects or balance after a player has taken it, the player may replace it with another spell of the same or lower level.
                </p>
            <h3>Brutality Mode</h3>
                <p class="bodtxt">
                    Death save failures can only be removed on long rests with food and drink, similar to levels of exhaustion. Rolling a natural 20 will not give a character 1 hp unless the player already has at least one successful death save.
                </p>
