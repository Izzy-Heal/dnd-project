    <p class="bodtxt">Classes and subclasses from the following sourcebooks are legal for play: PHB, XGE, TCE, DMG, EGW*, FTD.</p>
    <p class="bodtxt">Additionally, custom classes or subclasses listed in player options are legal, as are Matthew Colvilles Illrigger, and Michael Wolf's Shaman.</p>
    <p class="bodtxt">Custom Spell Lists: Some classes, such as Paladins, Warlocks, Illrigger, and Druids, can have variable patrons or dietys. For example, you may choose to be a 
        hexblade warlock of an elemental lord. On such occasions, you may discuss with your Gamemaster on exchanging certain spells on your spell list with their
         discretion to better fit your patron or chosen diety.</p>
    <p class="bodtxt bottom">*While both wizard subclasses from EGW are legal, Echo Knight is banned from play, due to the excessive packets and questions introduced by simply choosing the class.</p>
