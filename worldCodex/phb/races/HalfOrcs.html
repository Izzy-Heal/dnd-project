    <h1>Half-Orcs</h1>
    <h2>The Old Conquerors</h2>
        <p class="r_desc">
            When the mountains were young, the god known as Grog created the prosperous orc species which has since fallen into a greedy, ruthless culture that reminisces about the days of yore. The orcs were made for war, which, when combined with human blood, births a being in constant conflict with itself. Half-orcs revel in the dangers and ferocity of combat but are not defined by it. They can now break free from the drums of war.
